<h2>My Favourite Movies of All Time </h2>
<hr />
<h3> The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A cult classic feel good movie widely regarded as the best movie of all time. The story, plot twist and nearly everything about the movie is perfect down to the very last detail.</p>
<h3> All Quiet on the Western Front</h3>
<p>"It's neither an accusation nor acceptance of blame, it's meant to display the cruelty of war". <br />HIGHLY DEPRESSING<br /> but one of my all time favourites.</p>
<h3>Klaus</h3>
<p>Something that I'll definately show to my kids eventually. Shows how culture/ traditions come into play in a realistic yet magical manner. ALSO promotes critical thinking amongst kids to figure out which practices are fun and harmless and which need to be done away with</p>
